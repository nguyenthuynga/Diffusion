# Score-Based Generative Modeling: Application for Sea Surface Turbidity Reconstruction
This tutorial is a 3D input setting (2D dimension+1D for the time series) using Unet3D (with conv3D)

The purpose of this code is to do interpolation/filling gap/image inpaiting for sea surface turbidity (remote sensing) dataset.

Code, link to download data, and explanation of the case study is included in the notebook SPM_conditionalMask_cropArea_DWS_3D_Conv3D_tutorial_March26th2025.ipynb.

If something in the code isn't clear for you, don't hesitate to contact me at nga.nguyen@imt-atlantique.fr
