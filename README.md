# Score-Based Generative Modeling: Application for Space-Time Interpolation for Sea Surface Turbidity Reconstruction
This tutorial introduces a 3D input setting (2D spatial dimensions + 1D time series) using Unet3D with convolutional 3D layers.

The objective of this code is to perform interpolation (or fill gaps or conduct image inpainting) for sea surface turbidity datasets obtained through remote sensing.
